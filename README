Welcome to **BioPrograma**, a repository curated by [Alexandre Bruni Cardoso](https://github.com/brunicardoso), Associate Professor at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. This collection features Jupyter Notebooks and supplementary materials designed to teach bioimage analysis using Python, complementing the content presented on the [BioPrograma YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbJAU7N9FYvwkdgSwD_1S4Q).


## Overview

Bioimage analysis is a critical skill in modern biological research, enabling the extraction of meaningful data from complex imaging datasets. This repository provides hands-on tutorials and code examples to guide learners through various bioimage analysis techniques using Python. The content aligns with the tutorials available on the [BioPrograma YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbJAU7N9FYvwkdgSwD_1S4Q), offering a comprehensive learning experience.

## Getting Started


1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Some notebooks include environment files (e.g., `.yml` or `.txt`) specifying required packages. Locate these files corresponding to the notebook you wish to use and install the dependencies accordingly. For example:
     ```bash
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     conda activate bioimage-analysis
     ```
   - Alternatively, install general dependencies using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Navigate to the desired notebook in your web browser to begin.

## Usage

Each Jupyter Notebook in this repository focuses on a specific aspect of bioimage analysis, ranging from image preprocessing to advanced segmentation techniques. The notebooks are designed to be self-contained, providing the necessary theoretical background along with practical code examples.

To make the most of these resources:

- **Follow Along with the YouTube Tutorials**: Each notebook corresponds to a video tutorial on the [BioPrograma YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbJAU7N9FYvwkdgSwD_1S4Q). Watching the videos can provide additional context and explanations.

- **Engage with the Code**: Modify the code snippets, experiment with different parameters, and observe how the results change. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of bioimage analysis techniques.

- **Stay Updated**: New notebooks and materials are added regularly. Keep your local repository up to date by pulling the latest changes:
